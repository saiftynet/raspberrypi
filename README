INSTALLATION

0) Make sure you have all pre-requisites.  Check out http://goo.gl/uHRZq

1) Extract the files (you probably have already done this if you are reading this)
2) Copy the attached piStatus.pl and piGears.pl files to the cgi-bin directory
3) Make them executable
4) Done!

At first run, piStatus will try and make a folder called scripts in the
document root.  This may fail if permissions are not set to allow this
(www-data or what ver the web server user is has to be allowed to write to
document root).  If such a folder exists, piStatus will try and use this
directory.  If this is not desired, set the folder you wish to use in
piStatus.pl.

A password is required to run shell commands.  The default is "secret"
without quotes.  Change this in the script to one you want.

    File editting has a "Save As" option
    Fixed error caused by variable ENV{"DOCUMENT_ROOT"} reporting across systems
     
    piGears now at version 0.5
    Logging can now be disabled to improve performance save on SD writes
    piGears Menu can be disabled
    INCLUDE allows code reuse, integrating a preprocessed script into runcode
    LIBRARY in first line puts resulting processed script into the lib folder
    PUSH and POP data from a data stack...to allow parameter passing
    Improvements of array handling...still incomplete
    
Changes in version 0.11
    
    Diagnostics included to see if piStatus has been configured correctly
    Partial fix of divide by zero error in some systems (System > Memory)
    Shell history modifications (show last command entered in history)
    System > dmesg error fixed
    
    piGears now at version 0.4
    Logging can now be disabled to improve performance save on SD writes
    
Changes in version 0.10

    Minor bug fixes and style optimisation

    piGears now allows for some whitespace in formulae
    Improved handling of formulae
    Some Array support has been added
    Multiple pin IO  write/read multiple pins data with one command.
    LABEL,GOTO, SUB and GOSUB
    PRINT extended using AT, COLOR, SIZE, ROTATE commands
    PLOT
    Math Functions sin, cos, tan, atan, asin, acos, log, sqrt


Changes in version 0.9

    Killing processes activated now.
    Detect if device is connected to WAN (for future implementation of "Update available")
    reset gpioLogs/chart now possible...this wipes previous logs completely
    Filemanager now shows filesize

    piGears is NOW at release stage now at 0.2
    Complete overhaul of line parser so one function parses, checks syntax, handles auto indentation, 
    Flow control is better now, IF..ELSE..ELSE IF, WHILE, TIMES
    Logging of IO changes...now can view changes using the Chart or pop Out in piStatus
    Parsing strings now possible to a limited extent, semicolons need to be escaped.
    Execution reulta in a 3 tabbed output containing Listing Logs and Console
    Execution logs have a 10k limit.
    Default view post execution is the Console...if Console is empty, Logs are shown.

Changes in version 0.8

    Shell Commands history now available
    Clicking on a command in the history allows re-execution of the command or correcting any typos
    Cosmetic changes to the shell
    gpioTable function altered so that it forces a reread of input pins
        
    piGears is still to be considered pre-release stage, still needs a lot of work
    Flow control is better now, 
    Listing and logging and execution accessible from a tabbed menu
    Better logging to allow debugging of the iterpreter and the script.
    Includes a console for PRINT outputs
    Tests validity of pins (autodetects board revision)
    Does not yet update gpioLogs...



Changes in version 0.7

    processes now allows you to see more details, by clicking on the pid. 
    logs unique IPs that connect to the pi

    piGear remains in pre-release, but now has improved features
    Auto indent, colour coded listing, more fluid 
  


Changes in version 0.6

    Upload File activated
    Changes to the way scriptmanager handles files with known extensions.
        i.e. HTML and image files are viewed as appropriate, and only pgl
        and scr (piGears files) are executable
    CSS Bar charts for memory, an idea borrowed from Kevin "Keschy"
    Process tree now tries to tidy up many processes that look the same
    Process tree and also identifies users connected
       Future version will include ability to kill runaway piGears scripts
    More of the look and feel now can be managed by CSS file
    piGears if integrated has a script pre-processor.  This is still iunder development,
       but is included so you can see how it might work in the future



Changes in version 0.5

    A task viewer using pstree is now in system menu
    Webserver environment variables now included in system menu
    Script manager now recognises pgl extension as executable and on execution calls the piGears interpreter
    Shell command improved
    Return of the GPIO Chart now in a colour coded table format
    Export GPIO collected data as csv

    Prevent creation of hidden files from script manager
    Fix bug that causes incorrect stats from top;
    Add "dmesg | tail" to system menu

Changes in version 0.3

    Reduce requests for password for shell access once granted
    Internal databaseless logging infrastructure.
    Simple logging of IO states,
    Partial file type detection, allows editing of HTML documents with piStatus, which are saved in the script folder, for Execution. This is a precursor to Scriptable modules.
    Use vcgencmd (if installed) to display temperature, clocks and codecs
    Better start up info
    Debug mode (use {host}/cgi-bin/piStatus.pl?debug=on
