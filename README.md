Some projects for rapsberry pis

These items were previously hosted at http://www.windon.themoon.co.uk

Not being an expert programmer or hardware developer, it is foolish for me to advise
the general public about how to do things on the Pi. However, I am greatly indebted
to those who freely offer up their knowledge and experiences on all sorts of matters.
These projects are dedicated to those teachers on the web.

I am learning to use the Pi, and as I learn, I make tools that may be useful to
others. These tools may also be improved on. All code and designs are GPL, feel
free to use as you wish. Just as importantly, if you feel I could do better,
your advice would be greatly appreciated.

Projects on thgis repository are:
1) piStatus...a web status monitor for the raspberry Pi monitoring the the pi's
and also over the GPIO  as well devices attached to the i2c ports, as well as
providing a sudo shell for executing commands on the pi.  It also integrates with
piGears

2) piGears...a programming language similar to BASIC that is interpreted by piGears
and allows control of the GPIO pins as well as output to a console.
